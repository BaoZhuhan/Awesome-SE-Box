### Course Reviews

**【A01025】Fundamentals of Programming and Experiments**

> "Fundamentals of Programming and Experiments" is the first course for freshmen to get in touch with programming, mainly introducing the basic syntax of the C language. Through this course, students can master basic programming concepts such as loop and selection structures, function encapsulation, recursive algorithms, and two different sorting algorithms: selection sort and bubble sort. Mastering the C language is very beneficial for understanding the operating mechanism of programs in computers. Compared to Python, the coding style of C language is closer to the underlying logic of computers.
> Professor Zhang Yong, who teaches this course, is very responsible and patient in his lectures, which helped me take an important first step in my computer science learning journey.

**【301306】Fundamentals of Data Structures**

> "Fundamentals of Data Structures" is an important course for the Computer Science and Technology major, taught using the C language. Through this course, students can master the basic concepts and implementation methods of various data structures, including arrays, stacks, heaps, queues, binary trees, trees, graph storage, binary search trees, min-heaps, and max-heaps. Mastering these data structures is crucial for improving programming efficiency and solving complex problems.
> Professor Wang Yunwu may seem a bit strict and meticulous about discipline issues, but his lectures are quite humorous and engaging. He is responsible and explains the content in a way that is easy to understand, giving me a comprehensive understanding and mastery of data structures.
